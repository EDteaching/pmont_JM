    " <b>INTRODUCTION:</b> This tutorial will help reinforce some of the lecture material on water vapour, evaporation and turbulent transfer processes. You will use a simulation model of the evaporation process (essentially the Penman-Monteith equation we covered in Lectures 8 & 9) to answer a small number of questions.  By doing so, you should begin to appreciate how sensitive the evaporation process is to its driving parameters e.g. solar radiation, vapour pressure gradient, atmospheric turbulence and vegetation-related factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your answers to the questions form part of the continuous assessment for this course and this is a summative assessment. You will be given access to a digital worksheet on Learn to record your answers and **you should complete the interactive worksheet on Learn by the date shown in the Course Handbook**. We give you a draft worksheet at the end of this document but copy your answers over to the Learn version for submission and assessment. \n",

    "## About the Penman-Monteith model\n",
    "In lecture 9, we discussed the advance that Monteith made to the Penman equation when he introduced resistances to water vapor transport that were associated with the vegetation. You can think of resistances in an analogous form to Ohm’s Law – for a given potential difference (voltage), current will flow at a rate determined by the electrical resistance of the circuit (I=V/R). The aerodynamic roughness of the vegetation will influence the ease with which water vapour can be removed from leaves, hence the ‘surface roughness term’, introduces the aerodynamic resistance (ra) which is a function of wind speed and roughness length (see the tutorial web page for the formula). The taller and rougher the vegetation, the smaller will be $r_a$ (all else being equal). See Oke (1987) Boundary Layer Climates, page 70 for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was recognized in the 1960’s that plants were not merely ‘passive wicks’ in the evaporation process but were able to control their loss of water to some extent by opening and closing their stoma. The degree of closure of the stomatal aperture can be a function of solar radiation, internal CO2 concentration, soil water availability and other factors as discussed in the lecture. The P-M equation treats canopies comprised of individual leaves as one big leaf with canopy (or bulk surface) resistance (rs) being a measure of stomatal movement. In this simplified version of the evaporation process, bulk surface resistance is determined by the soil moisture deficit as we discussed in the lecture. Liquid water sitting on the surface of leaves, of course, is readily available for evaporation and wet leaves in the model are given a surface resistance of 0.\n",

    "In the version of the P-M model we use here, the soil moisture deficit is used to determine the value of the bulk surface resistance ($r_c$ also sometimes called the canopy resistance) for a particular land surface type. The aerodynamic resistance ($r_a$) is controlled by the value of wind speed you choose. You should recognise the following two figures from the lecture - the UK Met Office produce an estimate of SMD across the country as a service to farmers, builders, insurance companies etc using a slightly more sophisticated version of the model we use here (taking into account seasonal differences in vegetation height leaf area index and albedo for instance); this figure shows the varialbility across the UK in August 2018 and you could use this as a basis for determining how evaporation rates for the same crop type would vary by region acrosss the country. The second figure shows an experiment (by Dr Graham Russell who used to teach on an earlier version of SWAP at Edinburgh!) in which $r_c$ was determined as a function of SMD - and this relationship is assumed to hold for a number of different plant and tree species (but with different minimum values of $R_c$). When you change the SMD in the model below, an equation predicts $r_c$ and feeds that back into the model calculation of evaporation rate.  \n",

Some values have been pre-calculated - you should be able to re-create these results to convince yourself that you are using the model correctly.  [8]  \n",

What comments do you have on this, bearing in mind the results in the Table in Q1?  [6]  \n",
